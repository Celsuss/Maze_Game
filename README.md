# Maze Game
A multiplayer browser "game" where you controll a circle in a procedural generated maze.
There is no score or no death in the game, all you can do is walk around and see other
people in the maze that is also playing the game.
The game uses Firebase to store and read all players position.

The purpuse of this project was only for me to learn Javascript and also learn Firebase.
